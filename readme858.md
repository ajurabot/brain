Understood. Let’s do a final clean slate of everything, including a full printout of all the necessary files and a detailed README. If it doesn’t work, I’ll provide a request to escalate the issue to a higher-level ChatGPT model to ensure a smoother process.

Full Server Setup

Here’s the complete final setup, with all the necessary files.

⸻

1. requirements.txt

Flask==3.1.0
requests==2.32.3
openai==0.27.0
gunicorn==23.0.0
werkzeug==3.1.3

2. server.py

import os
import json
import requests
import openai
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Get environment variables
TELEGRAM_TOKEN = os.getenv("TELEGRAM_TOKEN")
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Set up OpenAI API client
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Telegram API URL
TELEGRAM_API_URL = f'https://api.telegram.org/bot{TELEGRAM_TOKEN}'

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    update = request.get_json()  # Parse incoming request

    # Get the chat_id and the message text
    chat_id = update['message']['chat']['id']
    message_text = update['message']['text']
    
    # Print the received message (for debugging)
    print(f"Received message: {message_text} from chat_id: {chat_id}")

    # Query OpenAI API for a response to the user's message
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # You can replace with any GPT model you prefer
        prompt=message_text,
        max_tokens=150
    )

    # Extract the AI response
    ai_response = response.choices[0].text.strip()

    # Send the AI response back to the user on Telegram
    send_message_url = f"{TELEGRAM_API_URL}/sendMessage"
    response_message = f"Ajura AI received: {ai_response}"
    response = requests.post(send_message_url, data={
        'chat_id': chat_id,
        'text': response_message
    })

    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Message sent successfully!")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to send message. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    
    return 'OK', 200

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=10000, debug=True)

# Ajura AI Bot Setup Guide

## Overview

This project is designed to integrate a Telegram bot with OpenAI's GPT model to create a chatbot. The bot receives messages via the Telegram API, sends them to OpenAI's API for processing, and then sends the response back to the user on Telegram.

## Prerequisites

1. **Telegram Bot Token**: Create a new Telegram bot by chatting with [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) and getting the token.
2. **OpenAI API Key**: You need to sign up on [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) and get your API key.

## Steps for Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-name>

2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed. Then install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables in your hosting platform (e.g., Render, Replit, etc.) or create a .env file:
	•	TELEGRAM_TOKEN: Your Telegram bot token (generated via BotFather).
	•	OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key.

Example .env file:

TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_telegram_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

4. Start the Server

You can now run the server locally or deploy it to a cloud platform like Render:

python server.py

This will start a Flask server on port 10000.

5. Set Webhook for Telegram Bot

Once the server is running, set the webhook for your Telegram bot to point to your deployed URL.

curl -F "url=https://your-deployment-url/webhook" https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-telegram-token>/setWebhook

This will set up the webhook, so your bot listens for messages and sends them to your server.

Troubleshooting

Common Errors:
	1.	ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘openai’
	•	Ensure you have installed the dependencies from requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt.
	2.	404 Not Found (on Render)
	•	Ensure that the webhook is correctly set up and the route /webhook is accessible.
	3.	Failed to Send Message (Status Code 400)
	•	Check if the message is correctly formatted when being sent to Telegram.

Future Enhancements
	•	Implement automatic handling for multiple OpenAI accounts for load balancing.
	•	Enhance error handling and logging for easier debugging.
	•	Add more security measures like encryption for communication.

### If it doesn't work:

1. **Submit Request for Higher-Level Support**: 
   If issues persist, it might be necessary to escalate the problem to a higher-level ChatGPT model or even the OpenAI support team to refine the process further.

   **Request:**
   > "Can you help to ensure that my integration with OpenAI API for a Telegram bot works efficiently, including considerations for deployment, proper routing, and efficient handling of API calls? Additionally, could you help investigate potential issues like webhook setup and suggest improvements for scaling up the bot?"

---

### Next Steps:

- **Deploy and Test**: 
   Deploy the full setup and test by sending messages via your Telegram bot. Ensure the OpenAI model responds as expected.
- **Scale**: 
   If successful, we can discuss scaling the system, improving security, and possibly introducing load balancing with multiple OpenAI keys for greater efficiency.

### Conclusion:

If the deployment is successful, you’ll have a working integration that serves as the foundation of your goal. Otherwise, I’m here to help escalate or refine things further as needed. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
